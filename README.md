# EPIC â€“ Block 3

## Performing Prescriptive Analysis for Societal Impact

---

### Project Overview:
>   The aim of this project is to leverage analytics techniques to extract valuable insights
>   from a carefully selected dataset, obtained from sources like Kaggle or UCI, with a
>   focus on addressing societal concerns. By applying a systematic Data Science
>   Workflow (DSW), the project requires students to explore and understand the
>   intricacies of the dataset, and develop and implement predictive models that can
>   provide prescriptive solutions to real-world challenges. The goal is to improve
>   decision-making processes by potentially optimizing one of the implemented models.
>   Through rigorous analysis, model implementation, and comprehensive
>   reporting/presentation, the project seeks to demonstrate the practical applications of
>   EPIC for societal impact. 

For our project, we are researching Global CO<sub>2</sub> levels in the atmosphere by building 
Machine Learning models. Our datasets are sourced from both NASA and Google Maps.
