# EPIC â€“ Block 3<br /><br /><sup>Performing Prescriptive Analysis for Societal Impact</sup>

### Project Overview
>   The aim of this project is to leverage analytical techniques to extract valuable insights from our chosen datasets, 
>   with a focus on addressing societal concerns. For our project, we are analysing CO<sub>2</sub> levels in the atmosphere and surface
>   temperatures for a significant number of countries across the globe.<br /><br />
>   By applying a systematic Data Science Workflow, we aim to thoroughly explore and understand the various intricacies of our
>   datasets, allowing us to develop and create predictive machine learning models that can provide prescriptive solutions to 
>   the continuing global concern of rising temperatures, global warming, climate change, and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.

### Project Setup Guide

<br />

#### Cloning the Repository
>  Navigate to a suitable directory on your machine and clone the repository using the commands below,
>  then switch to this new directory, whose name is ``Epic_3`` (unless you specify otherwise).
>  ```
>  ~ cd projects
>  ~/projects (main) git clone https://github.com/Elle0-0/Epic_3.git
>  ```

<br />

#### Installing Project Dependencies
>  Use the appropriate setup script for your machine, stored in the ``setup`` folder. 
>  These scripts are designed to handle the creation and activation of a Python virtual environment,
>  and automatically install the project requirements.
>
>  Windows (cmd)
>  ```
>  ~/projects (main) .\setup\setup.bat
>  ```
>  Windows (Powershell)
>  ```
>  ~/projects (main) ./setup/setup.ps1
>  ```
>  Linux (bash)
>  ```
>  ~/projects (main) source ./setup/setup.sh
>  ```
