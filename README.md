# EPIC – Block 3<br /><br /><sup>Performing Prescriptive Analysis for Societal Impact</sup>

### Project Overview
>   The aim of this project is to leverage analytical techniques to extract valuable insights from our chosen datasets, 
>   with a focus on addressing societal concerns. For our project, we are analysing CO<sub>2</sub> levels in the atmosphere and surface
>   temperatures for a significant number of countries across the globe.<br /><br />
>   By applying a systematic Data Science Workflow, we aim to thoroughly explore and understand the various intricacies of our
>   datasets, allowing us to develop and create predictive machine learning models that can provide prescriptive solutions to 
>   the continuing global concern of rising temperatures, global warming, climate change, and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.
