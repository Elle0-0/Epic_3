# Project Setup Guide

## Cloning the Repository
>  Navigate to a suitable directory on your machine and clone the repository using the commands below,
>  then switch to this new directory, whose name is ``Epic_3`` (unless you specify otherwise).
>  ```
>  ~ cd projects
>  ~/projects (main) git clone https://github.com/Elle0-0/Epic_3.git
>  ```

## Installing Project Dependencies
>  Use the appropriate setup script for your machine, stored in the ``setup`` folder. 
>  These scripts are designed to handle the creation and activation of a Python virtual environment,
>  and automatically install the project requirements.
>
>  Windows (cmd)
>  ```
>  ~/projects (main) .\setup\setup.bat
>  ```
>  Windows (Powershell)
>  ```
>  ~/projects (main) ./setup/setup.ps1
>  ```
>  Linux (bash)
>  ```
>  ~/projects (main) source ./setup.sh
>  ```

After following these steps, you are welcome to run any Python files in our project.
